# Snap collector plugin - Docker

This plugin collects runtime metrics from Docker containers and its host machine. It gathers information about resource usage and performance characteristics. 

It's used in the [Snap framework](http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting Started

In order to use this plugin you need Docker Engine installed. Visit [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for detailed instructions how to do it.
Plugin was tested against Docker version 1.12.3.

### Operating systems
* Linux/amd64
* Darwin/amd64 (needs [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/installation/mac/))

### Installation
#### Download the plugin binary:

You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture from the plugin's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-docker/releases) page. Download the plugin from the latest release and load it into `snapteld` (`/opt/snap/plugins` is the default location for Snap packages).

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-docker
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-docker.git
```

Build the Snap docker plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
It may take a while to pull dependencies if you haven't had them already.
This builds the plugin in `./build/`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Load the plugin and create a task, see example in [Examples](#examples).

#### Configuration parameters
It's possible to provide configuration to plugin via task manifest.

In order to setup Docker Remote API endpoint and procfs path in **workflow** section of a task configuration file it is necessary to include following:

    workflow: 
      collect: 
        config: 
          /intel/docker: 
            endpoint: "<DOCKER_REMOTE_API_ENDPOINT>"
            procfs: "<PATH_TO_PROCFS>"

where *DOCKER_REMOTE_API_ENDPOINT* is an endpoint that is being used to communicate with Docker daemon via Docker Remote API,
where *PATH_TO_PROCFS* is a path to proc filesystem on host.

For more information see [Docker Remote API reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/)

## Documentation
There are a number of other resources you can review to learn to use this plugin:
* [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
* [Docker runtime metrics](https://docs.docker.com/v1.9/engine/articles/runmetrics/)

Notice, that this plugin using default docker server endpoint `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` to communicate with docker deamon.
However, adding support for custom endpoints is on Roadmap.

Client instance ready for communication with the given
// server endpoint. It will use the latest remote API version available in the
// server.
### Collected Metrics

The list of collected metrics is described in [METRICS.md](METRICS.md).

### Examples
Similar to dream levels in the movie _Inception_, we have different levels of examples:
* LEVEL 0: Snap running on your system (Linux only).
* LEVEL 1: Snap runs in a container.
* LEVEL 2: Snap runs in a docker-in-docker container.

For the sake of ease-of-use, these examples are presented in reverse order.

#### Run example in a docker-in-docker container
```
./examples/tasks/run-docker-file.sh
```

#### Run example in a docker container (Linux or Darwin only)
```
./examples/tasks/run-dockerception.sh
```

#### Run example on your Linux system

Check if there is some running docker container(s):

```
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

ad5221e8ae73        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"         36 minutes ago      Up 36 minutes                     		suspicious_mirzakhani

In one terminal window, start the Snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1 and trust disabled):
```
$ snapteld -l 1 -t 0
```

In another terminal window download and load plugins:
```
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-collector-docker/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-collector-docker
$ wget http://snap.ci.snap-telemetry.io/plugins/snap-plugin-publisher-file/latest/linux/x86_64/snap-plugin-publisher-file
$ chmod 755 snap-plugin-*
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-docker
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-file
```

You can list all of available metrics:
```
$ snaptel metric list
```

Download an [example task file](examples/tasks/docker-file.json) and load it:
```
$ curl -sfLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-docker/master/examples/tasks/docker-file.json
$ snaptel task create -t docker-file.json
Using task manifest to create task

Name: Task-02dd7ff4-8106-47e9-8b86-70067cd0a850

```
